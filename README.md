# Projects
This is a branch with all of the projects and coding that I have done during my education career.

The next lines are summaries of these games, and what I have done for each part.

WARNING: These games are files for Unity and GameMaker. There is c# or gml code files within. I know that the c# files can be found in the unity games under Assets/scripts. The gml files can be found under their respective script folders.

These files showcase the coding capabilities that I have and the projects that I have worked on.
